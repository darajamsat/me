## DIRECTORSHIP AT ICF
As the first UX director at ICF, my role was primarily around growth, growth of talent, growth in skillsets, and growth in business. I cultivated relationships with other groups and divisions to promote UX capabilities and add staff to projects, while at the same time working in business development by actively responding to Request for Proposals. When I started my team, we had 5 UX generalist. I increased the team to over 500% and added specialties in research, UX/UI, front-end design, UX strategy, and product strategy. Nurturing and mentorship continue to be valuable in retaining talent, I accomplish this though individual design coaching, knowledge shares, and through a training conference I founded that also includes our partners in delivery and development. I also manage a team portfolio that is over 20 projects, while actively serving as a design lead for select complex projects.

## HIGHLIGHTS FROM PROJECT EXPERIENCE
### User Experience Lead, Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality(CBSHQ) | ICF | 2016 – Present
Over the past 8 years, I have led the product and design vision for CBSHQ web properties. This includes completely overhauling the front-end experience to make the reports more accessible to users and improve the readability of the site, improving data visualization tools, and removing redundant information to streamline the content. Through collaboration with my client to understand the needs of researchers, policy makers, and other people needing to work with government data. I utilized best practices to create usable, accessible, multi-device experiences. Proved my solutions with human centered design, including the utilization of metrics, heat mapping, and other tools in addition to user testing to experiment and iterate when developing and maintaining a website. And worked with a team of developers, business analyst, and project managers to bring these visions to life.

### Product Strategist, Office of Population Affairs | ICF | 2016 - 2018
I led a complete redesign of the OPA’s Title X Locator, creating a streamlined, user-friendly experience for citizens seeking information on clinic locations and services. Working with raw data files, I developed enhanced reporting functionality for administrators and regional officers, transforming manual workflows into efficient digital processes that allowed for easier management and reporting of grantee information to government officials. I guided a remote, cross-functional team through a highly collaborative design and development process, ensuring seamless integration and effective results.

### Lead of User & Customer Experience | CustomInk | 2013 - 2016


### Architect Leadership at Siteworx | 2010 – 2013
As the Experience Architect at Siteworx, my role was to establish best practices and standards for the user experience and visual design teams. I removed the silos that had existed between these two departments and joined them together for collaboration on design solutions. I also brought leads from the development teams into our process to help designers understand technical constraints while solutioning and created a content strategy specialty to make sure that content would be properly structured for content management systems, and so that voice and tone could be reflected in content creation. I also mentored the beginning BA practice in running Agile processes. I played an integral part in the sales process though creating dynamic presentations in response to request for proposals and participating in orals challenges. I was directly credited for winning work for organizations such as the National Gallery of Arts and Bridgespan. I received several accolades for my work with Mandarin Oriental, Time Warner Cable, and a Webby for PlasticSurgery.org.

### Lead Experience Architect, Time Warner Cable | Siteworx | 2011 - 2013
I lead 5 concurrent projects with Time Warner Cable to consolidate their web
properties into one consistent brand. This included two projects for Residential, Business Class, MyAccounts, and RoadRunner. Each of these projects, were moved from static HTML web pages to content managed pages using Adobe Experience Manager. This move required both front-end experience and database design. I led a team of visual and user experience designers, content strategist, and front-end developers through a Design Agile process to deliver assets to the TWC internal development team. I then consulted with the internal team on implementation

### Senior Experience Designer | AOL Shopping | 2007 - 2010
After MapQuest, AOL Shopping was the second largest channel at AOL, bringing in millions of page views each day. I was responsible for creating new shopping experiences which encouraged shoppers into a purchase pathway for participating brands. Through research and testing with potential shoppers, studying real world experiences, and examining the data feeds from the incoming products, I envisioned measurable experiences that complete revolutionized the channel. Most significantly, were the internal team changes that I ushered, including changing our documentation to be wiki-based, modularly structured, and united both product and design requirements. This allowed developers to synthesis information more quickly and supported our Agile Development processes for collaboration.
