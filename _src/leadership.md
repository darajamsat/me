# A Visionary Director in User Experience

As a Director of User Experience, my career has been defined by a commitment to growth, mentorship, and impactful change. With over 15 years in user experience design, I have had the privilege of building and leading high-performing UX teams, driving digital transformation, and creating human-centered design practices that resonate with users and clients alike. My journey has been shaped by a lifelong passion for art, technology, and people—bringing these together to build experiences that are both innovative and meaningful.

## Leading with Empathy and Vision

My approach as a director is deeply rooted in empathy and understanding. I believe in putting people first, both in my team and in the design solutions we create. As the Director of UX at ICF, I began with a team of five generalists and expanded it by over 500%, introducing specialized skills in research, front-end design, UX strategy, and more. By recognizing each team member’s unique talents, I have fostered a collaborative environment where everyone can grow, feel valued, and contribute to our mission of delivering powerful, user-centered solutions for our clients.

## Transforming Organizations and Processes

Throughout my career, I’ve embraced the challenge of not only designing interfaces but also redefining processes to enhance collaboration and efficiency. At Siteworx, for example, I led the transition to a design-thinking and agile development framework. This shift broke down silos and fostered cross-functional teamwork that became the foundation for delivering complex, multi-million-dollar projects for clients like Time Warner Cable, Mandarin Oriental, and the National Gallery of Art. My ability to bridge gaps between design and development has enabled our teams to produce cohesive, high-quality work that consistently meets—and often exceeds—client expectations.

## Building and Nurturing Diverse Teams

Diversity and inclusion are at the heart of my leadership philosophy. I understand firsthand the challenges and barriers faced by underrepresented groups in tech, and I am committed to creating an inclusive environment where diverse voices are heard and celebrated. At ICF, I have worked to build one of the most diverse teams within the company, bringing in a range of perspectives that enrich our work and drive more innovative, effective solutions. Mentorship is a priority for me; I actively coach team members, sharing my experiences to support their growth and helping them navigate their careers with confidence.

## Strategic Leadership and Impactful Solutions

In my role, strategy is just as essential as creativity. From crafting digital experiences for clients like the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ) to leading the redesign of Title X locator tools for the Office of Population Affairs, I have delivered solutions that prioritize usability, accessibility, and inclusivity. My strategic insights have not only improved user experiences but have also driven tangible business results. By leveraging metrics, user testing, and data-driven design, I ensure that every solution is aligned with both user needs and client objectives.

## Recognized Excellence and Industry Contributions

Recognition from industry peers is humbling and rewarding, validating the hard work of both my team and myself. I am proud to have received a Webby Award for my work with PlasticSurgery dot org, a MarCom Platinum award, and, most recently, a “Women of Color STEM - Technology Rising Star” award. These honors reflect my dedication to excellence and my commitment to creating experiences that are accessible, meaningful, and transformative.

## Shaping the Future of User Experience

My directorship is more than just a position—it’s a calling to elevate user experience as a discipline that truly serves people. I am passionate about the power of mentorship, the importance of inclusion, and the potential of design to make a positive impact. Moving forward, I am excited to continue this journey, always looking for new ways to innovate, inspire, and contribute to the growth of the UX community.
